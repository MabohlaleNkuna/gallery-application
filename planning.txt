Gallery app plan

React Native Image Gallery App - Full Project Plan

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a mobile image gallery app that allows users to capture images, view images in a gallery or full-screen mode, and display geolocation information of where the images were taken on a map. SQLite will be used for storing image metadata.

1. Initial Setup

  - Create a new React Native project using Expo or React Native CLI:
     npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank

 - Install version 51 for my app with the following command:
	npm install expo@51

  - Install necessary dependencies for the app:
    - For typescript: npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-native
                    :  npx tsc --init
    - For image capture: react-native-camera, expo-camera
    - For map integration: react-native-maps, expo-location
    - For SQLite: react-native-sqlite-storage, expo-sqlite
    - For geolocation: react-native-geolocation-service, expo-location
    - For state management (optional): redux or context API
    - For UI elements: react-native-paper, react-navigation

    Install dependencies example:
    npm install react-native-camera react-native-maps expo-location react-native-sqlite-storage


2. Image Capture Functionality
- Capture Images:
  - Implement the camera functionality using react-native-camera or Expo's camera.
  - Allow the user to take pictures and store them in the device's file system.
  
- Store Image Metadata:
  - When saving images, include the following metadata:
    - Timestamp: Date and time the photo was taken.
    - Geolocation: Latitude and longitude of the location where the photo was taken.
    - File path: Path where the image is stored locally.

- Handle Permissions:
  - Ensure that necessary permissions are requested for using the camera and geolocation.

3. SQLite Integration
- Install SQLite Storage:
  - Use SQLite to store image metadata including file paths, timestamps, and geolocation.
  - Set up a local SQLite database to store this data.

- Implement CRUD Operations:
  - Implement the basic CRUD operations for managing image metadata in SQLite:
    - Create: Add new records when capturing images.
    - Read: Retrieve image metadata from the database to display in the gallery.
    - Update: (Optional) Allow updating metadata.
    - Delete: (Optional) Allow deleting images and metadata.

- Test Database Functionality:
  - Test CRUD operations using sample data and ensure the database works as expected.

4. Image Gallery
- Design Grid/List Layout:
  - Create a grid or list layout for displaying the images stored in the gallery.
  - Display images with thumbnails and allow full-screen viewing.

- Full-Screen and Carousel View:
  - Implement full-screen view for images and carousel functionality for swiping between images.

- Navigation:
  - Use React Navigation to navigate between the gallery and full-screen view.

5. Geolocation and Map Integration
- Integrate Geolocation:
  - Use the device's geolocation API (expo-location or react-native-geolocation-service) to get the location when capturing an image.
  - Save the geolocation (latitude and longitude) in the image metadata.

- Map Integration:
  - Use react-native-maps to display a map in the app.
  - Show markers on the map for each image location.
  - Allow users to click on a map marker and see the corresponding image in the gallery.

6. Search and Filter Features
- Implement Search Functionality:
  - Implement search by metadata, such as location or date, to find specific images in the gallery.

- Add Filter Options:
  - Allow users to filter images based on criteria such as:
    - Date range
    - Location
    - Tags (if any)

7. User Interface
- Design Aesthetic UI:
  - Create a user-friendly interface with the following features:
    - Image Thumbnails: Display small previews of images.
    - Navigation Buttons: Allow users to navigate between the gallery and full-screen view.
    - Search Bar: Implement a search bar for quick image lookups.
    - Pinch-to-Zoom: Allow users to zoom into images and the map using pinch gestures.
    - Swipe Gestures: Allow users to swipe between images in the carousel.

- Ensure Responsiveness:
  - Make the app responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

8. Security and Permissions
- Handle Permissions Properly:
  - Ensure the app properly requests permissions for camera access, location services, and file system storage.

- Implement Security Measures:
  - Ensure that sensitive data such as geolocation is handled securely and stored appropriately.

9. Testing and Debugging
- Test Functionality:
  - Perform functional testing on all app features to ensure everything works as expected, especially image capture, gallery, map integration, and search features.

- Test Performance:
  - Test the app’s performance, particularly with a large number of images. Ensure smooth image loading and map rendering.

- Fix Bugs:
  - Address any bugs or issues identified during testing.

10. Documentation and Final Touches
- Write Documentation:
  - Provide user and developer documentation for the app.
  - Document the codebase, explaining the structure, dependencies, and important functions.

- Prepare Presentation:
  - Prepare a presentation demonstrating the app’s features, including image capture, gallery functionality, geolocation tagging, and map integration.

- Final Testing and Code Review:
  - Perform a final round of testing and code review to ensure everything is working and up to standards.

11. Deployment
- Deploy App:
  - Deploy the app on a test device and ensure installation works as expected.
  - Push the final version to GitHub and share the repository link.
